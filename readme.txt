Steps to Run the Project:

Step 1: Download ganache 
Step 2: npm install -g truffle in cmd
Step 3: We can connect by importing the account and by giving the private key of the transaction from ganache to metamask and connecting network rpc ganache 
Step 4: Then type in 
		truffle migrate --reset 
	and compilation starts that is it deploys the smart contract to block chain
Step 5: Then type in
		 npm run dev 
	which starts the server on the frontend and pops up the localhost:3000 and then we can execute the project.
